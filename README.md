## Personal analysis Clear statement of long term goals

### Personal Analysis

I am personally happy with where I am in my life at the moment. I am happy with my family, and I am happy with my work. Work has consistently kept up the challenges. In order to keep myself current, I have been able to push myself to learn more and tackle new problems that I previously did not know how to solve. Expanding knowledge of front end development and development tools has been a weekly goal where I try to consume a few articles and learn something new.

### Long term goals (5 - 10 years)

**Architecture, UX**

Long term I would like to see myself in  more of a senior front end role. I would like to model myself as a User Experience specialist with an eye for good User Interface design. Web Architecture and dev ops will be more fluent to me and I will feel confident in leading a team of developers on a large scale web product with a large user base. Creative development is something I would also like to spend some time on in the future, working with good designers and team members to have something recognized in the creative development world.

## Clear statement of short term goals (1-4 years)

**Expand backend knowledge, expand creative development**

In the short term I would like to expand my knowledge of back end development. Though its not where I most enjoy working I believe it is necessary to have a good understanding of back end code and have the ability to step up and help out the team when back end changes are needed. Creative development is something I have always been interested in. I would like to explore more creative aspects of web development with WebGL, animations, and generally beautiful websites with creative interactions and execution.

## Specific work schedule for the coming years, which aid you achieve the goals within the time frame.

To acheive my goals I will spend time once a month on a coding side project in order to hone the skills necessary to become a more well rounded engineer. The project will include back end technologies that I need to become more versed in as well as some more creative front end browser technologies that I would like to learn.

In order to become a more senior developer I will be sure to take on more responsibilities, engage more with my peers and coworkers as well as clients. This will help me feel comfortable discussing projects and workflow as well as making decisions and providing direction.

## Corrective actions to be taken in case of failure to achieve the set goals.

Should I fail to achieve these goals within my timeframe I will take a moment to rewrite and reassess my personal development. If my goals have changed I will need to write new goals for myself. If my goals still stand but have not yet been acheived then I will take stock of where I could have gone wrong and attempt to get back on track for acheiving my goals at a new set timeframe.
